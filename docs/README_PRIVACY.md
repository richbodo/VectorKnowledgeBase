# Privacy Implementation Guide

## Overview

This README provides information about the privacy controls implemented in the Vector Knowledge Base application and how to test them.

## Privacy Implementation

The privacy implementation focuses on protecting sensitive query data throughout the entire processing pipeline:

1. **Request Handling**: All incoming requests are filtered to prevent logging of sensitive data
2. **Query Processing**: Query content is never logged in its raw form
3. **Vector Search**: When searching the vector database, queries are protected from appearing in logs
4. **Embedding Generation**: When generating embeddings, text content is never logged
5. **Error Handling**: Special error handling prevents query content from appearing in exception logs

For full implementation details, see [Privacy Controls Documentation](./privacy_controls.md).

## Privacy Testing

The privacy implementation includes testing tools to verify that sensitive data is not leaked:

### Running Privacy Tests

1. Ensure the application is running
2. Execute the test script:

```bash
./utils/run_privacy_tests.sh
```

This will:
- Make test requests with sensitive sample data
- Check logs for any content leakage
- Generate a test report in `test_reports/` directory

### Manual Testing

You can also manually test the privacy controls:

1. Make a request to the API with sensitive content:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key" \
  -d '{"query": "This is sensitive information"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/api/query
```

2. Check the logs to verify no sensitive data was leaked:

```bash
tail -n 50 app.log | grep -v "QUERY CONTENT REDACTED"
```

## Ongoing Privacy Monitoring

For ongoing privacy protection:

1. Regularly review logs for any privacy leaks
2. Run the privacy test suite after any code changes
3. Keep the `PrivacyLogFilter` patterns updated for new data formats

## Implementation Details

The privacy implementation is spread across several files:

- `utils/privacy_log_handler.py`: Core privacy filtering implementation
- `main.py`: Request middleware privacy filtering
- `services/vector_store.py`: Privacy protection in vector search
- `services/embedding_service.py`: Privacy protection in embedding generation
- `api/routes.py`: Privacy-enhanced API request handling

## Future Enhancements

Planned future privacy enhancements:

1. Machine learning-based PII detection for more accurate identification
2. Automated PII scanning in uploaded documents
3. User-configurable privacy controls
4. Enhanced privacy metrics and reporting
