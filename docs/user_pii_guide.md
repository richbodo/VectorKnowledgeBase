# User Guide: PII Protection

## What is PII?

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is any data that could identify you specifically. This includes:

- Your name, address, phone number
- Email addresses
- Social security number, passport number, or other government IDs
- Credit card or bank account numbers
- Healthcare information
- Biometric data
- IP addresses or device information

## How We Protect Your PII

Our Vector Knowledge Base application has built-in privacy protections to ensure your sensitive information remains secure:

### Privacy in Queries

When you submit a query, our system:

- Never stores the actual content of your queries in logs
- Filters out sensitive information before storing any data
- Ensures that error messages don't reveal your query content
- Uses secure connections for all data transmission

### Document Privacy

When you upload documents:

- Document content is processed securely
- Only authorized users can access the documents
- System logs never contain the full content of your documents
- Metadata about documents is separated from actual content

### System-Wide Protection

Throughout the system:

- All logs are filtered to remove potential PII
- API communications are protected with authentication
- Database access is limited and monitored
- Regular security audits ensure continued protection

## Best Practices for Users

To maximize your privacy protection:

1. **Be cautious with sensitive data in queries**: Though our system filters PII, it's best to minimize sensitive information in your queries
2. **Use document references**: Rather than including sensitive data in queries, reference document names or topics
3. **Review search results**: Before saving or sharing search results, check for any sensitive information
4. **Report concerns**: If you believe sensitive information is being exposed, contact the administrator immediately

## Privacy Testing

Our PII protection has been rigorously tested to ensure:

- Query content is properly redacted in logs
- Error messages don't expose sensitive data
- Document metadata is properly separated from content
- Authentication and authorization work properly

## Questions and Support

If you have any questions about how we protect your personal information, or if you need assistance with privacy concerns, please contact the system administrator.
