# PDF Knowledge Base Roadmap

## Future Research Areas

### 1. Minimizing User Data Retention in Logs

**Current State:**
- Application logs contain user query information and API request details
- Detailed logs are necessary for debugging but may contain sensitive information

**Research Objectives:**
- Implement log rotation and automatic purging of old logs
- Create different logging levels for production vs. development
- Develop a privacy-focused log sanitizer that removes PII
- Implement a configurable data retention policy

### 2. Document De-duplication on Upload

**Current State:**
- System allows duplicate PDF uploads without detection
- Duplicates consume extra storage and embedding resources
- Search results may contain redundant information

**Research Objectives:**
- Develop fingerprinting methods for PDF documents (hash-based or content-based)
- Implement similarity detection during upload process
- Create a user-friendly way to handle duplicates (reject, version, or replace)
- Optimize storage by eliminating redundant embeddings

### 3. Web Interface Authentication

**Current State:**
- API endpoints require API key authentication
- Web interface lacks user authentication
- Administrative functions accessible to anyone with access to the deployment URL

**Research Objectives:**
- Implement basic auth or more advanced authentication (OAuth, JWT)
- Create user role system (admin, regular user)
- Secure sensitive endpoints in the web interface
- Develop an authentication system that works both in development and production

### 4. Installation and Deployment Documentation

**Current State:**
- Limited documentation for new developers
- Deployment process requires manual steps
- Environment variables and configuration settings not fully documented

**Research Objectives:**
- Create comprehensive setup guides
- Document all required environment variables
- Provide examples for different deployment scenarios
- Develop automated testing for deployment verification
